Refined Lee Filter
The presence of speckle noise in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images makes the interpretation of the contents difficult, thereby degrading the quality of the image. Therefore an efficient speckle noise removal technique needs to be sought. In this paper, we present a SAR image despeckling method known as Refined Lee Filter (RLF). The method is based on the well-known Lee filter. In this method the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is employed to adjust the number of neighbour pixels used within the sliding window. Simulation results obtained from the performance evaluation metrics used showed that the proposed method improved the performance of the original Lee filter when they were both used to despeckle standard test images contaminated with speckle noise and SAR images.

Sentinel-1 SAR GRD: C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Ground Range Detected, log scaling
The Sentinel-1 mission provides data from a dual-polarization C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument at 5.405GHz (C band). This collection includes the S1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes, processed using the Sentinel-1 Toolbox to generate a calibrated, ortho-corrected product. The collection is updated daily. New assets are ingested within two days after they become available.

Multivariate regression model from water level and production
Water management tools are necessary to guarantee the preservation of natural resources while ensuring optimum utilization. Linear regression models are a simple and quick solution for creating prognostic capabilities. Multivariate models show higher precision than univariate models. In the case of Waiwera, implementation of individual production rates is more accurate than applying just the total production rate. A maximum of approximately 1,075 m3/day can be pumped to ensure a water level of at least 0.5 m a.s.l. in the monitoring well. The model should be renewed annually to implement new data and current water level trends to keep the quality.

Global Surface Water
This dataset contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2021 and provides statistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces. For more information see the associated journal article: High-resolution mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes (Nature, 2016) and the online Data Users Guide.

Dynamic World:
Dynamic World is a 10m near-real-time (NRT) Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) dataset that includes class probabilities and label information for nine classes.
Dynamic World predictions are available for the Sentinel-2 L1C collection from 2015-06-27 to present. The revisit frequency of Sentinel-2 is between 2-5 days depending on latitude. Dynamic World predictions are generated for Sentinel-2 L1C images with CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE <= 35%. Predictions are masked to remove clouds and cloud shadows using a combination of S2 Cloud Probability, Cloud Displacement Index, and Directional Distance Transform. Images in the Dynamic World collection have names matching the individual Sentinel-2 L1C asset names from which they were derived. Learn More:Data:Dynamic World V1
